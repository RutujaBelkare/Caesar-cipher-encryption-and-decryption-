The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. This project implements the algorithm in Python to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters of the alphabet by a specific number of positions, known as the "shift value."

The project provides an interactive program where users can:

Encrypt plaintext into ciphertext.
Decrypt ciphertext back into plaintext.
Exit the program when finished.
